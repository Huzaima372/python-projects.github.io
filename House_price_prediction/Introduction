🎥 Project Demo Video: media/video.mp4

This project demonstrates the use of Machine Learning (Linear Regression) 
to predict house prices based on multiple features such as income levels, 
average rooms per household, population, and location-related factors.  
It provides an end-to-end implementation from data preprocessing to 
model evaluation and prediction.

-------------------------------
📌 Features
-------------------------------
- Loads the California Housing Dataset from scikit-learn.
- Converts dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including summary statistics 
  and correlation analysis.
- Visualizes data with a correlation heatmap using Matplotlib.
- Splits data into training and testing sets for proper evaluation.
- Trains a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices.
- Evaluates the model with:
  • Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  • R² Score
- Provides a user input system to predict custom house prices.
- Applies StandardScaler to improve prediction accuracy.

-------------------------------
📊 Workflow
-------------------------------
1. Load California housing dataset
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Correlation heatmap visualization
5. Model training using Linear Regression
6. Model evaluation using MAE & R² Score
7. Custom predictions based on user input

-------------------------------
🚀 Purpose
-------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to showcase how regression models can 
be used in real-world applications like predicting house prices.  
It serves as a practical example for students and beginners in 
Machine Learning and Data Science.
