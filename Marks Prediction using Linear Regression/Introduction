Marks Prediction using Linear Regression
📌 Project Description
This project predicts student marks based on study hours using a Linear Regression model. 
It is a simple yet powerful example of how machine learning can be applied to real-life 
educational scenarios.

The project workflow includes:
Dataset Loading
Reads data from hours_marks_50.csv containing:
Hours (number of hours studied)
Marks (marks obtained by students)
Model Training
Defines independent variable X = Hours and dependent variable y = Marks.
Fits a Linear Regression model using Scikit-Learn.
Model Evaluation

Calculates error metrics to evaluate performance:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Prediction from User Input
Accepts a custom input (number of study hours).
Predicts expected marks for that input using the trained model.

Example:
ENTER HOURS TO PREDICT MARKS = 5
After Studying 5 Hours: You Maybe Obtained 48 Marks

Visualization
Plots Hours vs Marks scatter graph with regression line.
Shows comparison between actual values and predicted values.

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas – Data handling
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib – Visualization
Scikit-Learn – Machine learning (Linear Regression, metrics)

📊 Key Outputs
Performance Metrics:
MAE → Average absolute prediction error
MSE → Squared error
RMSE → Root of squared error, interpretable in marks scale

Graphical Output:
Scatter plot of actual data
Regression line of predicted marks

💡 Highlights of This Project
Beginner-friendly supervised learning example
